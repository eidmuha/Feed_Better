## Audience

Restauranteurs who are constantly worried about what their customers think about their food and want to address any problems their 
customers may have with food quality immediately without waiting for it to turn into a negative review, which is permanent.

Foodies who want to comment about the food, without causing a scene or leaving a negative review, which could be damaging to the 
restaurant. The restauran chatboard offers a real-time exchange between customer and restauranteur to facilitate free-flow 
communication. 

People who dine alone and want to stay socially engaged with their immediate surroundings through the chatboard.

University students are adventurous when it comes to food. Because they have a budget, they are more likely to look into reviews before 
they spend. They want to know how to get the best value for my limited lunch and dinner allowance and whether the chef is in a good mood 
today so that I don't end up regretting my spend. 

Adds a whole new atmosphere to going to a restaurant. Adds a whole new dynamic to the whole restaurant eating experience.

Tourists who enter an area and are wondering what the long queue is in front of the restaurant is about, and able to engage with the 
crowd waiting or eating inside to ask what is good without being intrusive or awkward.

Restauranteurs who want to manage their food inventory better by offering specials on the chatboard to encourage take up by customers
presently inside the restaurant, or those who are engaged with the restaurant chatboard.
